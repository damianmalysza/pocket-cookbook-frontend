# Pocket Cookbook

Note that this serves as the frontend for the following backend: https://github.com/damianmalysza/pocket-cookbook-backend

Pocket Cookbook is an single page application that lets you view, add, and delete recipes that are stored in the rails backend. Recipes each have a category which are represented as tabs. A user can navigate to each tab and the recipes for selected tab will render on the screen. A user can then drill down to a specific recipe to view ingredients and directions for it. A user can also delete recipes from that screen.

This application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Bootstrap is being relied on for styling so the 'styles.css' file is currently serving as a placeholder for any future custom styling that may want to be done.
